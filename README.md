# random_generator
shuffle() function shuffles the given static list randomly

1. Takes 3 inputs lower limit, upper limit and how many random numbers user wants.
2. created while loop until count exhausts.
3. inside while loop i am calling the random_number() function, which takes two arguments minimum number and maximum number.
4. In random_number(), i am using a formula to generate random number of the given range
5. For better resultes i used shuffle function to give random integer number to be used in the formula
6. Final result is a list of total random numbers which user asked from algorithm to generate
7. This algoritm is generating numbers without 73% (towards upper limit) 27% (towards lower limit) ratio
8. Didn't get much time after office, otherwise would have solved it as well.

Thank You
